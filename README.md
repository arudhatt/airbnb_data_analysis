Exploring the Landscape of Airbnb: A Data-Driven Journey
In recent years, Airbnb has revolutionized the way people travel, offering unique accommodation options and experiences in destinations across the globe. This project aims to delve into the rich dataset provided by Kaggle to uncover insights, patterns, and trends that characterize the platform's ecosystem. By leveraging data visualization techniques and statistical analysis, I seek to gain a comprehensive understanding of various aspects such as pricing dynamics, property types, geographical distribution, and user preferences. Then I use XGBoost and CatBoost to predict the log_price.

The primary objective of this project is to extract actionable insights from the Airbnb dataset through exploratory analysis. Key goals include:

Understanding the distribution of Airbnb listings across different regions.

Exploring the relationship between listing attributes (e.g., location, property type, amenities) and pricing.

Identifying trends in user behavior and preferences.

Predicting the log price using a data model.
